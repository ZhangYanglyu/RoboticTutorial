## Link-connection description

* link length $a_{i-1}$
* link twist  $$

### First link

* link length $a_0 = 0$
* link teist  $\alpha_0 = 0$
* if joint 1 is revolute, $d_1 = 0$, only have $\theta_1$
* if joint 1 is prismatic, $\theta_1 = 0$, only have $d_1$

### Last link

* link length $a_n = 0$
* link teist  $\alpha_n = 0$
* if joint n is revolute, $d_n = 0$, only have $\theta_n$
* if joint n is prismatic, $\theta_n = 0$, only have $d_n$
